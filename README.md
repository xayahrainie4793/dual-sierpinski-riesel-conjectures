* Original Sierpinski conjecture base *b*: Finding and proving the smallest *k* such that *k*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1 is composite for all *n* ≥ 1
* Original Riesel conjecture base *b*: Finding and proving the smallest *k* such that *k*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1 is composite for all *n* ≥ 1
* Dual Sierpinski conjecture base *b*: Finding and proving the smallest *k* such that *b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*k* is composite for all *n* ≥ 1
* Dual Riesel conjecture base *b*: Finding and proving the smallest *k* such that *b*<sup>*n*</sup>−*k* is composite for all *n* ≥ 1 such that *b*<sup>*n*</sup> > *k*+1

Requirements and inclusions:

1. Conjectures must have a finite covering set
2. Primes must be *n* ≥ 1
3. *k*-values that are a multiple of base (*b*) are included in the conjectures (for original Sierpinski/Riesel conjectures) but some may be excluded. See exclusion 4 below

*k*-values with any of the following conditions are excluded from the conjectures:

1. All *n*-values are covered by one trivial factor
2. All *n*-values are covered by algebraic factors or a combination of algebraic and trivial factor(s)
3. Make generalized Fermat numbers, i.e. *q*<sup>*m*</sup>×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1 where *m* ≥ 0 and *q* is a root of the base *b* (for original Sierpinski conjectures) or *b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1 (for dual Sierpinski conjectures)
4. *k* is a multiple of base (*b*) and *k*+1 (for Sierpinski) or *k*−1 (for Riesel) is not prime. They will have the same prime as *k*/*b* (for original Sierpinski/Riesel conjectures)
